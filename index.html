  <h1>NetOS - The User-friendly Linux Distro</h1>
  <p>Hi, and welcome to the NetOS website! In case you don't know what NetOS is, it's a distro that aims to be both user-friendly and customizable. So it's perfect for beginners that don't even know a single command!
Even more, it's based on the <b>popular</b> Linux distro - Debian, so it has both <code>dpkg</code> and <code>apt</code> pre-installed on it.</p>
